# Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It's intelligent enough to build all app dependencies based just on your file imports. It starts from a list of modules defined as entry points and recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module the application needs.
This exercise is to practice how webpack works.
